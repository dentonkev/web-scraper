# web-scraper
Two mini web-scraper projects.

1. Trip Advisor
- Web-scraper that pulls data from [TripAdvisor](https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/) to get the top attractions in Sydney and put the data into an excel file. Built using the playwriter library.

2. Stock Prices
- Web-scraper that pulls data from [Finviz](https://finviz.com/) to get the value of a stock and send it to the user, built with BeautifulSoup4 and Selenium. Takes user input and searches finviz for the current value.
